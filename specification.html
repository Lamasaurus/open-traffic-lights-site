            <h3>Publishing real-time data</h3>
            	The status plan of a crossing can change every X subseconds. To enable clients to retrieve these updates as fast as possible while keeping the server cost low, a publishing mechanism is proposed by relying on standards HTTP/2 and SSE.
	            <h4>Server-Sent Events (SSE)</h4><p>
	            	SSE is a very simple method for publishers to push events over HTTP to clients:
	            	<ul>
	            		<li>A client sends a request to a server through the EventSource interface that contains the SSE API.</li>
	            		<li>The server keeps the connection open, sets the mime-type to text/event-stream and streams events back.</li>
	            		<li>That's it. Both the server as the client can choose to close the stream.</li>
	            	</ul>
	            <h4>HTTP/2</h4>
	            		<p>This new version of HTTP has the advantage to combine streams over the same connection, which is called multiplexing. This means that a client can dynamically subscribe to multiple streams (read: traffic lights) without opening/closing a TCP connection every time.</p>
	            		<p>This also takes away the disadvantage of SSE over HTTP/1.1 where the browser has a limited amount of connections to the same domain.</p>
